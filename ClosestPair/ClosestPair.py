# python
# implement a divide and conquer closest pair algorithm
# 1. check read and parse .txt file
# 2. use the parsed result as the input
# 3. find the closest pair in these input points
# 4. output the closest pair and the distance between the pair
#	output format
#	The closest pair is (x1, x2) and (y1, y2).
#	The distance between them is d = xxx.
